# LiminalGan
A stylegan2 model trained on liminal space images

Total images: 

~2500 unique interior center cropped images from r/Liminalspace, @Liminalplaces and @spaceliminalbot
~1300 unique exterior center cropped images from r/Liminalspace, @Liminalplaces and @spaceliminalbot

trained with ADA from: https://github.com/RoyWheels/stylegan2-ada, implemented from https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2

total of 6 model snapshots are used for visualization: 2 from non mirrored interiors,  2 from mirrored interiors, 2 from non mirrored exteriors
